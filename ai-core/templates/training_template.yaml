  entrypoint: core
  arguments:
    parameters:
      - name: BATCH_SIZE
        description: The number of training examples processed in one iteration during training. It determines the size of each batch in the training dataset.
      - name: CONTEXT_LENGTH
        description: Defines the maximum length of input sequences, typically representing the number of tokens in each sequence or block of text.
      - name: ITERATION_LIMIT
        description: Specifies the maximum number of iterations or training steps to be performed during the training process. It controls the duration of the training loop.
      - name: EVAL_FREQUENCY
        description: Indicates how often model evaluation occurs during training, measured in the number of iterations or epochs between evaluations.
      - name: EVAL_STEPS
        description: Represents the number of evaluation steps to perform during each evaluation period. It determines the granularity of evaluation within each evaluation cycle.
      - name: LEARNING_RATE
        description: The rate at which the model parameters are updated during training, influencing the size of the steps taken in the parameter space to minimize the loss function.
      - name: EMBEDDING_DIM
        description: Determines the dimensionality of the embedding vectors used to represent tokens in the model. It impacts the expressive power of the model's embedding layer.
      - name: ATTENTION_HEADS
        description: Specifies the number of parallel attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism of the model. Each head learns different aspects of the input data.
      - name: NUM_LAYERS
        description: Represents the total number of transformer layers in the model architecture. It controls the depth and complexity of the model.
      - name: DROPOUT
        description: The probability of dropping out neurons or connections between layers during training, helping prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating some units.
      - name: DICTIONARY_SIZE
        description: Indicates the size of the vocabulary or dictionary used by the model, representing the total number of unique tokens or words in the dataset vocabulary.
